  <h2>Ceremony & Reception</h2>

  <p>The BBQ evening, the wedding celebration, and the breakfast will all take place at or in our <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KKGJwHJKFqVHryDB6"><u>house</u></a>.</p>
  <p>Our outdoor wedding ceremony will take place in our <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gXcHKHWoNzjfZjMZ6"><u>olive grove</u></a> next to our house. At 3 pm we would like to enjoy this special moment with you among the olive trees and the beautiful view. Find more information about the timeline below.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Arrival & Parking</h2>
  <p>There are several airports that work well for your trip. The most convenient is usually Rome Fiumicino, as there are many daily flights to and from Germany. Rome Ciampino is also easy to reach. Other good options are Perugia (the closest), Pisa (often very affordable), and Florence (well connected, though we found fewer suitable flights).

Simply check which airport works best for you – Google Flights or Skyscanner are helpful for orientation. In our experience, booking directly with the airline is often worthwhile.

From the airport, the easiest way to reach us is by car. Alternatively, you can take a train to Orvieto or Fabro/Ficulle; connections from Rome to Orvieto are particularly good. You can find suitable trains on trenitalia.it. Important to know: Italy has several train operators, and tickets are usually not interchangeable between them. However, we’ve always had good experiences with the train system.

From Orvieto or Fabro, it’s about 15–20 minutes by car to our place.

Please arrange your travel to our house individually. There is sufficient parking in front of the house or in the olive grove. We’re happy to help coordinate carpool options – just indicate in the questionnaire whether you’ll be arriving by car or would like a ride. Please also include the location of your accommodation so we can plan transportation for the evening of the wedding.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Accommodation</h2>
  <p>You can find accommodations via websites like booking.com, Airbnb or Vrbo. For your reference - our house is located <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KKGJwHJKFqVHryDB6"><u>here</u></a>. The nearest town is Ficulle (approx. 5 minutes by car), Orvieto is about 20 minutes away.</p>
  <p>Since our celebration takes place around Easter, it’s advisable to book early so you can secure a suitable place to stay.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Dress Code</h2>
  <p>We look forward to spring-festive outfits – colourful and cheerful is very welcome. Jeans can stay in the wardrobe this time. Please think of something warm for the evening and shoes that are comfortable in the garden.</p>

  <h2>Holiday in the Region</h2>
  <p>The region around our location is beautiful – gentle hills, small villages and delicious food. We live in Umbria; Perugia, Assisi, Città della Pieve, Lago di Bolsena and Orvieto are wonderful places we warmly recommend visiting. 
    We are in the middle of a beautiful wine region that invites you to visit one or more wineries. Marchesi Antinori, Tenuta Vitalonga and Cantina Castel Noha are just a few excellent and partly internationally known wineries in our village of Ficulle. 
    (Fun fact: our house carries the crest of the Antinori family; we still haven’t found clear information about its background.) Further north from Ficulle you reach Tuscany quickly. If you want to spend more time holidaying here, Montepulciano and Montalcino are well-known for their good wines 
    and historic charm. Siena, Volterra, San Gimignano, Arezzo and of course Florence are also worth a visit.</p>
  <p>Tip for all who travel via Rome: On Easter Sunday the Pope gives the traditional “Urbi et Orbi” blessing in Rome, which means the city will be very crowded. It’s best to plan around that day.</p>
