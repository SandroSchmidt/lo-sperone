    <h2>Where will the celebration and ceremony take place?</h2>

    <p>
      The BBQ on Thursday, the wedding celebration on Friday and breakfast on Saturday will all take place at or in our 
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KKGJwHJKFqVHryDB6"><u>house</u></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our humanist wedding ceremony will take place in our 
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gXcHKHWoNzjfZjMZ6"><u>olive grove</u></a> next to the house. 
      At 3 pm we would like to enjoy this special moment with you, surrounded by olive trees and a beautiful view.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Arrival & Parking</h2>
    <p>
      The easiest way to get here is by car, as public transport in the area is limited. There is plenty of parking space on site.
      If you travel by train: there is a direct train to Orvieto from both Rome and Florence. From Orvieto it is about a 
      20-minute drive to our house.
      Please organise your journey yourself. We are happy to help you find a lift with other guests. In the questionnaire, 
      please indicate whether you are coming by car or need support.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Dress code</h2>
    <p>
      We are looking forward to springlike festive outfits – colourful and joyful. Jeans can stay in the wardrobe this time.
      Please bring something warm for the evening and shoes that are comfortable to wear in the garden.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    <p>
      You can find accommodation via booking platforms such as booking.com, Airbnb or Vrbo. The nearest village is Ficulle 
      (about 5 minutes by car); Orvieto is around 20 minutes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As our celebration takes place over Easter, we recommend booking early so you can find a place that suits you.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Holiday in the region</h2>
    <p>
      The area around our home is beautiful – rolling hills, small villages and great food. We live in Umbria; places such as 
      Perugia, Assisi, Città della Pieve, Lago di Bolsena and Orvieto are wonderful destinations that we highly recommend.
      We are right in the middle of a wine region, inviting you to visit one or two wineries. Marchesi Antinori, Tenuta Vitalonga 
      and Cantina Castel Noha are just a few of the very good and partly internationally known wineries in our village, Ficulle
      (fun fact: our house bears the coat of arms of the Antinori family – we have not yet found a clear explanation for this).
      Further north from Ficulle you quickly reach Tuscany. If you plan to spend more time there, Montepulciano and Montalcino 
      are well known for their excellent wines and historic charm. Siena, Volterra, San Gimignano, Arezzo and of course Florence 
      are also well worth a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small tip for those arriving via Rome: on Easter Sunday, the Pope gives the traditional “Urbi et Orbi” blessing in Rome, 
      so the city will be very crowded. It may be worth planning around this.
    </p>
